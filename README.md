well as you can see there is some comentation in the main file , it does not need any specific pakage to be installed for running ,
the idea is simply using some criteria or standart to scale the behavior of one who plays the game and using ML ideology  make future dicisions more precise and lower the number of questions in result.
i'd be happy to know your comments about this little project. thank you
